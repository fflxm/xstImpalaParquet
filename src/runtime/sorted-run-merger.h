/// tuple in sorted order at the top of the heap.
///
/// Merged batches of rows are retrieved from SortedRunMerger via calls to GetNext().
/// The merger is constructed with a boolean flag deep_copy_input.
/// If true, sorted output rows are deep copied into the data pool of the output batch.
/// If false, GetNext() only copies tuple pointers (TupleRows) into the output batch,
/// and transfers resource ownership from the input batches to the output batch when
/// an input batch is processed.

/// can return batches with FLUSH_RESOURCES set, the merger must have 'deep_copy_input'
